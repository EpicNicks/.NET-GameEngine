# Config File Templates
The way I currently see config files being used. This should be codified in serializable classes later.
These should be editable from Visual Studio or whichever editor the project itself is being edited from or an in-editor GUI.

## Current Templates
### NEngineProject.json
Relevant data required for the project being worked on.
### EditorConfig.json
Settings to modify the Editor settings across projects.
### ProjectConfig.json
Settings relevant to the specific project being worked on.
