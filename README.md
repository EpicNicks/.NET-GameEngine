# NEngine

## Summary
A Game Engine/Editor written in C# (because I like it) built on SFML (because it's simple enough) for my own learning purposes.

This project is a follow-up to earlier design attempts with modularity in mind as well as a well defined set
of Engine Intrinsics and Core Libraries.

The engine itself is meant to commit to a common API that may be reimplemented to use a different rendering
strategy such as OpenGL when I move on from SFML.

## Motivation
Mainly to improve my skills as a software architect and programmer.

I've always loved games programming and have had a desire to dig into what makes it all work.

## How to Build
Run the build script (TODO)
